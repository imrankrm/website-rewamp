        <h1>Hybrid Cloud</h1>
        <h2>“If you are ready to move up to the cloud, we can figure out a course that’s just right for you.”</h2>

        <p>Whether you need help in handling your on-premises environment or move operations off-premises, we can help.
            We build a custom cloud solution that will act as an extension of your data center. S cloud features
            enterprise-class infrastructure with technologies such as but not limited to VMAX, vBlock, Isilon, Cisco,
            UCS, and Zerto, to provide you “Peace-of-Mind as a Service.” We offer “cloud your way” with complete
            transparency. With data centers across the globe, we are fully certified and compliant. Our colocation
            services are backed by market leading SLA’s.</p>

        <h2>Archive</h2>

        <p> Every business needs a management tool where all the tedious tasks are handled with utmost care. Synectiks
            combines with multiple top-grade services to help mitigate risks of critical data. Retrieval and archival of
            data are not so easy in today’s highly competitive world. Management firms have to take a step ahead and
            think about the security and integrity of their critical data. By reducing cost and error-free backup
            management, we deliver high-quality solutions that meet your expectation.
            <br>
            Availability of data at all times is imperative, particularly when enterprises have to deal with diverse
            sectors at the same time. Not to mention old or new data, perpetuating data in an encrypted archive to
            ensure maximum security and compliance with data regulation policies is our prime motto. It is not necessary
            to store passive data on your costly storage and backup infrastructure. Synectiks cloud archive services are
            modeled to integrate directly with existing infrastructure.
            <br>We provide built-in security, encrypt data-in-motion and at-rest for each customer. With Synectiks
            Archive Service, customers can manage and control their data.

        <h2>Backup</h2>
        <p>Being a step ahead and preparing for liable disruptions is important. A business can be successful only if it
            anticipates the future disasters and has a robust and perfect backup strategy to encounter any unexpected
            inconvenience. The cloud-based backup strategy is cost efficient, secure, and simple. Venturing and
            implementing a backup proposal incorporates many challenging tasks, as data continues to grow rapidly and
            compliance requirements emerge, backing up your data becomes more perplexing every day. Is long-term
            retention affecting your backup infrastructure to fall out of control? Are you concerned about the
            recoverability of old tapes?
            <br>Synectiks offers secure cloud backup solutions that organize from fully managed to simple offsite
            retention of long-term backups. We can help you institute a backup solution that works perfectly for your
            specific needs.

        <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
        <p>If there is a plan for success, there must also be a plan for the risk involved in the success path. Nothing
            short of a so-called term disaster. As customer expectations reach the pinnacle, enterprises are struggling
            hard to scope that expected goal and give the best service to its clients from all quarters. What if there
            is a breakdown of business continuity and disaster recovery? Disaster recovery management has become the
            walk and talk in every business. No matter small or medium or large scale business, managing disaster
            recovery and understanding the risks involved in it is crucial. Data is unlimited, mounting rapidly along
            with business requirements. Where there is data, there is something hidden in the data called the critical
            information, and when there is sensitive information, there must be a strategy to secure the information
            from the effects of any adverse events or security breaches. Traditional and legacy tactics to protect your
            dynamic data is not going to be the best options anymore. A reliable disaster recovery strategy overcomes
            and covers the risks such as risk of life to employees, disruption to Business Process, Management Control &
            Asset recovery. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) plays a significant role
            that determines an organization’s disaster recovery requirements. Synectiks DRaaS for enterprises enables to
            rapidly restore applications and data by failing over to Scloud according to your RTO and RPO.</p>
